  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">How long to run Air purifier in Bedroom?</h1>
  <p className="mt-3">Air purifiers are essential devices for keeping indoor air clean. A common question that many houseowners have is how long to run air purifier in bedroom? The ideal runtime for an air purifier depends on several aspects such as the air quality in the bedroom, its size, the type of device and your specific needs.</p>
  <p className="mt-3">For better results, I would suggest running the air purifier continuously if you have allergies, asthma or pets. While sleeping, the air purifier should be opearated for at least 8-12 hours daily to effectively filter allergens and polutants. If your device has an auto mode, it’s recommended to use it. The air purifier can adjust the fan speed based on the air quality, helping to save energy.</p>
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-3">Factors that affect the runtime of an air purifier in the bedroom</h2>
  <ol className="mt-3 list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><span className="font-bold">Room size and air purifier capacity:</span> A good capacity air purifier should clean the air 2 to 4 times per hour (2-4 ACH). For larger bedrooms, you either need to run the purifier for a longer duration or use one with a higher CADR rating.</li>
    <li><span className="font-bold">Factors related to air quality:</span> To remove dust, pollen and pet dander, run the air purifier 24/7. For smoke or odors , first run the air purifier on high speed then switch to low speed or ‘auto mode’ depending on availability. For general air cleaning running the air purifier for 8-12 hours is usually sufficient.</li>
    <li> <span className="font-bold">Noise sensitivity:</span> Many modern air purifiers produce very low noise (around 30db) on low settings. If noise bothers you in the bedroom, you can use the low fan speed or sleep mode.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-3">Final Recommendation</h3>
  <p className="mt-3">For the cleanest air, you can run your air purifier in the bedroom for 8 to 12 hours daily while sleeping. If you have issues like allergies, asthma, pets or smoke you can run it 24/7 on low or auto mode. Adjust the runtime based on the room size and air quality. To save energy, choose an Energy-star certified purifier, use auto mode and clean or replace the filters regularly.</p>
